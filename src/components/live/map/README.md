# Map Implementation

## OpenStreetMap Integration

This project uses **OpenStreetMap** via Leaflet for displaying maps in the emergency dispatch system. This provides several advantages:

### Benefits of OpenStreetMap
- **No API Key Required**: Unlike Google Maps or MapTiler, OSM is completely free
- **Open Source**: Community-driven, always up-to-date
- **Privacy-Friendly**: No tracking or data collection
- **Reliable**: Global coverage with detailed street-level information
- **Customizable**: Easy to style and modify for emergency dispatch needs

### Implementation Details

The map component (`src/components/live/map/Map.tsx`) uses:
- **Leaflet.js** for map rendering
- **OpenStreetMap tiles** as the base layer
- **Custom styling** optimized for emergency dispatch visibility
- **Enhanced markers** with drop shadows for better visibility
- **Improved popups** with backdrop blur and better contrast

### Features
- Responsive design that works across all devices
- Custom pin markers for emergency locations
- Smooth animations when updating map center
- Optimized for emergency dispatch scenarios with enhanced contrast
- No external API dependencies

### Alternative Tile Layers

The implementation includes commented code for alternative tile providers:
- **CartoDB Positron**: Cleaner, lighter style ideal for data overlay
- **OpenStreetMap Standard**: Current default with good detail balance

To switch tile layers, uncomment the desired layer in the Map component and replace the `osmLayer.addTo(map.current)` call.

### Styling

Custom CSS in `map.module.css` provides:
- Enhanced contrast for better visibility
- Drop shadows on markers
- Modern popup styling with backdrop blur
- Optimized colors for emergency dispatch use

### Migration from Previous Solutions

This replaces:
- ❌ Google Maps (NewMap.tsx) - Removed due to API costs and complexity
- ❌ MapTiler integration - Removed to eliminate API key dependency
- ✅ Pure OpenStreetMap - Free, reliable, and perfect for emergency services
